Algorithms for Computing Statistical Moments of Geometric Measures

The code in this repository is an implementation of efficient algorithms for computing the statistical moments of geometric measures of d-dimensional point-sets. The implemented algorithms refer to the following measures:

- Mean Pairwise Distance for points in d dimensions (distribution where exactly s points are selected unriformly at random).
- Bounding box volume for points in 2 dimensions (distribution where each point is selected with fixed probability).
